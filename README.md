### Hi, I'm Callis 👋🏾

Glad that you came around. I am a Cloud engineer 👨🏿‍💻.

I am excited about the use of Emerging Technology and Enterprise Cloud Applications to solve real life problems.

I research on Compliance, privacy and ethics for AI with Openmined.org.

My <a href="https://codepen.io/callezenwaka">Codepen</a> page has awesome demos. So are other demos on <a href="https://github.com/callezenwaka">github</a>.

I founded and carry out IT consultancy through <a href="https://www.barewave.com">Barewave.com</a>

My personal projects are listed below:

<a href="https://www.algoboard.com">Algoboard</a> - An EdTech platform that supported schools during the COVID-19 lockdown. I am currently pivoting the platform.

<a href="https://www.algoforms.com">Algoforms</a> - An low code platform for organization that collect data in remote regions. It is an offline first application with background sync embedded.
