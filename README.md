### Hi, I'm Callis üëãüèæ

Glad to have you around. My work interfaces at the intersection of Enterprise Cloud Applications, Data Privacy & Emerging Technologies.

I solve real life problems using Emerging Technology and Enterprise Cloud Applications.

I research on Compliance, privacy and ethics for AI with Openmined.org where I have authored articles including:
- [Classifying the challenges of privacy enhancing technologies (pets) in IoT data markets.](https://blog.openmined.org/classifying-the-challenges-of-privacy-enhancing-technologies-pets-in-iot-data-markets/)
- [Understanding the role of privacy enhancing technologies (pets) in the IoT data market.](https://blog.openmined.org/understanding-the-role-of-privacy-enhancing-technologies-pets-in-the-iot-data-market/)

My [Codepen](https://codepen.io/callezenwaka) page has awesome demos. So are other demos on [GitHub](https://github.com/callezenwaka).

My personal projects are listed below:
